I am an Argentine software engineering student at the Polytechnic University of Madrid. I am interested in web development and mobile applications (at the moment I use JavaScript, PHP and Flutter). However, in the future I would also like to know about machine learning and other branches of the software. I am currently focusing my programming time on developing mobile applications with Flutter.
